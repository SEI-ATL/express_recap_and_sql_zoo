## Part 1: updating your `node`/`express` readme

This week you began a README that will serve as your central notepad for everything we learn about node and express. Update it to cover the following topics:
[ ] - setting up an express app
[ ] - creating routes within an express app
[ ] - sending text from the server back to the client
[ ] - sending html to the client using a view template
[ ] - referencing variables in your view templates

[ ] When you're finished updating your node & express readme, copy-paste it into        `node_express_readme.md` for submission!

## Part 2: sqlzoo
You will be doing an online interactive tutorial to level up your sql skills here: https://sqlzoo.net/

This tutorial is broken into units. It is not expected that you already know how to complete each unit: the units have progressive instructions, and you learn as you go. Units 0 - 5 are required as part of this weekend's deliverable, and units 6 - 8+ are bonus. If you're serious about becoming a strong developer, do the bonus units!

[x] - For each question, sqlzoo will tell you when you've nailed it. Copy&paste the correct answer under the corresponding question in `sqlzoo_results.sql`.

## Completion criteria
[ ] - For part 1, you have updated your node & express notes, and then pasted it into `node_express_readme.md`
[x] - For part 2, you have finished AT LEAST units 0 - 5 (hopefully 0 - 8+) of sqlzoo and pasted your correct queries into `sqlzoo_results.sql`.
